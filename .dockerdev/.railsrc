# This options will tell the "rails new" command to avoid the "bundle install" command
# that automatically follows files and directories creation.
# It also skip "webpack-install" that relies on "bundle install"

# "rails new" has a weakness : it tries to run "bundle install" with the default 
# version of bundler shipped with Ruby.

# 1) this leads to a "rails new" command that fails
# 2) This is a very bad thing,  if you want to use a 
#    centralized, unified, docker-defined version of bundler.
