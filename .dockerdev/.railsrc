# This options will tell the "rails new" command to avoid the automatic "bundle intall" command, and avoid the automatic "webpack-install" command
# "rails new" has a weakness : it tries to run "bundle install" with the default version of bundler shipped with Ruby.
# This is a very bad thing, if you want to use a centralized, unified, docker-defined version of bundler.

# Thus, to install a new Rails app, run "rails new myapp && cd myapp && bundle install && bundle exec webpacker:install"
